I have made the folders go first and also made the program write the directory's path on the top, so it looks like Windows Explorer.

Also you can open files(only text files!) and see what is written in them.
You are able to edit the file's content by adding and deleting using Backspace(however, you can't move the cursor).

By pressing Escape you will quit the file. But Before that you will have three choices whether to save the changes
you have made and whether not to do that, and whether you don't want to exit and just want to continue editing the file.

You can open directories, as well as exiting it, and you press the same buttons as you do in file.

The main parent directory is "C:\", so when you exit that directory, you will exit the program as well.
